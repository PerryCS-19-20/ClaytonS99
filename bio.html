        <h1> About me:<h1>
            <h2>My name is Clayton Smith and I am the creator of this page. I was born in Detroit and moved to AZ when I was 19 months old. 
            I am a Junior at Perry High. 
            My goal is to become an engineer and recieve a masters in 
            engineering at the University of Michigan (where my dad went). I am also a huge sports fan and avid gamer. 
            My favorite sports teams are all from Detroit; I love the Detroit lions, pistons, tigers, and red wings.
            Some of my favorite games include Battlefield, Skyrim, and Grand Theft Auto.
            Thanks for visiting, I hope you enjoy the site!
